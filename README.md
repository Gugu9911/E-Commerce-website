## Testing üîç
At GroceryHub, we value the importance of testing to ensure the reliability and robustness of our application. Initially, unit tests were conceptualized to verify the seamless operation of our state management logic, with the intention to use Jest and the React Testing Library, complemented by Mock Service Worker (msw) to simulate server responses for products, cart, and user interactions.
However, during the implementation phase, we encountered compatibility issues with Axios, which led to challenges in executing the testing strategy as planned. This hiccup has prompted our team to revisit the testing approach and explore alternatives that seamlessly integrate with Axios, ensuring that our test suites accurately reflect user interactions and data management within the app.
In the interim, we are conducting thorough manual testing across all functionalities to maintain our commitment to quality and performance. The resolution of this testing challenge is a top priority, and updates will be documented in our project logs.
